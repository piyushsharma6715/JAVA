# IDE generated code
 might look hectic
 the code for insertion and logincheck is written/checked at actionperformed of their respective jButtons.
 In my case i have used sql database therefore paste sql connector.jar in both JRE/ext folder inside both Jdk folder and Jre folder.
 While in case of oracle database you will have to paste the odbc.jar file in both the folders.
